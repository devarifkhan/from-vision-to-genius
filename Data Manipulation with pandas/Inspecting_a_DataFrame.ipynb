    "# Exploring a DataFrame in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a new DataFrame, it's essential to understand its structure and contents. Here are key methods to explore your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`.head()`** - Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "- **`.info()`** - Shows metadata about each column (data types, non-null counts)\n",
    "- **`.shape`** - Returns a tuple with (rows, columns) counts\n",
    "- **`.describe()`** - Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Dataset: Homelessness\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be working with the `homelessness` DataFrame which contains U.S. state-level homelessness data from 2018:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| `individual` | Number of homeless individuals not in families |\n",

    "| `state_pop` | Total state population |\n",
